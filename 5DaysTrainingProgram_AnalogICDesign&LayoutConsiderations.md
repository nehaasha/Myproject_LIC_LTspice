# DAY 1
## Introduction to MOSFET and Mixes- Signal IC Architecture

### Purpose of the session:
Day 1 of the workshop focused on building a strong foundation in core VLSI concepts. The session covered the fundamental concepts of MOSFETs, with emphasis on device equations and operating regions. In addition, an introduction to mixer signal ICs was provided, including a detailed explanation of the BGR circuit. The session also included an overview of the Cadence design environment, where the instructor explained the uses and importance of various toolkits in Cadence for circuit design and analysis.
### Introduction to Mixed Signal ICs
Mixed Signal Integrated Circuits (ICs) are circuits that contain both analog and digital components on the same chip. These ICs are designed to process real-world analog signals (such as voltage, current, temperature, sound, and light) and also perform digital processing (such as logic operations, control, and data storage).

In modern electronic systems, most signals from sensors and the environment are analog in nature, while processing and control are done digitally. Mixed signal ICs provide an efficient way to interface between the analog and digital domains.

Common examples of mixed signal ICs include:

Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC)

Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC)

Phase Locked Loops (PLL)

Power Management ICs (PMIC)

RF transceivers

Sensor interface ICs

Microcontrollers with built-in ADCs and DACs

Mixed signal ICs are widely used in applications such as mobile phones, IoT devices, automotive electronics, medical instruments, and communication systems.
