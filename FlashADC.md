### Abstract-
This paper presents the design and implementation of a 3-bit Flash Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) using discrete hardware components. Flash ADCs are widely recognized for their high-speed performance, making them suitable for applications requiring rapid data conversion. The proposed 3-bit architecture employs seven comparators, a precision resistor ladder network for reference voltages, and a digital encoder to produce a 3-bit binary output from an analog input. The hardware prototype was developed and tested to verify functionality. This work demonstrates the feasibility of implementing compact and efficient Flash ADCs in practical systems where high-speed analog signal digitization is essential.
